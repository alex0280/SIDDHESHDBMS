        <h1>Understanding Transaction Processing</h1>
        
        <h2>Definition of a Transaction</h2>
        <p>
            A transaction is a logical unit of work in a database system that consists of a sequence of operations performed as a single unit. 
            A transaction ensures that the database remains consistent and adheres to integrity constraints, even in cases of system failure. 
            Transactions are crucial in database management as they help in maintaining data accuracy, reliability, and consistency. 
            In practical applications, transactions typically involve multiple operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, or retrieving records. 
            The primary goal of a transaction is to transition the database from one consistent state to another while following the ACID properties 
            (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key Transaction Properties</h2>
        <center>
        <img src="photo4" height="250" width="500">
        </center> 
        <p>The ACID properties define reliable transaction processing:</p>
        <div class="box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atomicity</strong> - A transaction is either fully completed or not executed at all. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If a customer withdraws $500 from an ATM but the system crashes before the balance is updated, the transaction is rolled back.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Transactions must maintain database integrity, ensuring valid state transitions. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> When transferring money, the total sum of all accounts should remain the same before and after the transaction.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Isolation</strong> - The execution of transactions remains independent, ensuring that one transaction does not interfere with another. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If two users try to buy the last ticket for a concert at the same time, isolation ensures only one purchase is successful.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Durability</strong> - Changes made by committed transactions persist permanently, even in case of a system failure. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If an online purchase is confirmed, the order remains saved even if the server crashes.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Recoverability in Schedules</h2>
        <center>
        <img src="photo5" height="200" width="550">
        </center> 
        <p>Based on recoverability, schedules can be categorized into:</p>
        <div class="box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recoverable Schedules</strong> - Ensure committed transactions are not undone due to the failure of dependent transactions. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If T1 updates a product price and T2 uses that price to calculate taxes, T1 must commit first.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Cascadeless Schedules</strong> - Prevent cascading rollbacks by committing dependent transactions in order. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A hotel booking system ensures that a room reservation is only confirmed after verifying the guest's payment.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Strict Schedules</strong> - Ensure no transaction reads uncommitted data, thereby preventing inconsistencies. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A bank system restricts access to an account balance update until the previous transaction is fully committed.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Serializability in Schedules</h2>
        <center>
        <img src="photo6" height="300" width="550">
        </center> 
        <p>Types of serializability include:</p>
        <div class="box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conflict Serializability</strong> - Transactions can be reordered to form a serial execution without altering results. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If T1 updates product stock and T2 updates product price, their order can be swapped if they do not depend on each other.</li><br>
                <li><strong>View Serializability</strong> - Transactions yield the same results as a serial schedule but may not be conflict serializable. <br>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If T1 reads initial stock levels, T2 updates them, and T1 writes a final value, the execution order can be adjusted as long as the result is correct.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Transaction processing plays a vital role in database management by ensuring data integrity, reliability, and consistency. 
            The ACID properties provide a framework for designing robust transactions that maintain system stability. 
            Additionally, understanding different types of recoverability and serializability helps in creating optimized database schedules. 
            By adhering to these principles, databases can efficiently manage concurrent operations and prevent data anomalies, 
            ensuring a seamless experience for users in various applications such as banking, e-commerce, and online reservations.
